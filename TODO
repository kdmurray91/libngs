* Write a better fasta test and possibly tests for the other formats.

* Some includes are probably not necessary.  Clean that up.

* Fix several bugs in fastq2fasta:
  + opening the same file twice

* Valgrind

* Check the behavior of the program with pathological pathnames such as "".

* Make sure that the iter functions take a `const char*' as argument.

* Make a single option group for the whole libngs

* THe strdup("-") used for most ouput_path is evil. Memory leak. Change it!

* Add an option for more flexibility in the encoding of qualities in the fastq format.
