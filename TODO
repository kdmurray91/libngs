* Write a better fasta test and possibly tests for the other formats.

* Some includes are probably not necessary.  Clean that up.

* Fix several bugs in fastq2fasta:
  + opening the same file twice

* Valgrind

* Check the behavior of the program with pathological pathnames such as "".

* Factorize the code that writes a FastqSeq to a channel.  Or at least the code
  that turns a FastqSeq into a string.
