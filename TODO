* Write a better fasta test and possibly tests for the other formats.

* Some includes are probably not necessary.  Clean that up.

* For the various applications in the bin directory, renaming the
  application-specific data to something generic like `CallbackData' might be a
  good idea.

* Fix several bugs in fastq2fasta:
  + closing stdout
  + closing the same file twice (although, this may be up to the user ...)
