\section{Philosophy}

\subsection{Design}

The central component of this software is a library, located in
\texttt{src/libns}.
This library includes the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data structures
    \item IO routines
    \item Some algorithms (mainly kmer hashing for now)
\end{itemize}
The bulk of the library is written in C.
The parser are written in LEX.

Various binary programs are implemented using this libraries.
These can be found in \texttt{src/bin}.

Finally, a few shell, python and R scripts wrapping these binary utilities or
using their outputs are also provided.
These scripts are located in \texttt{src/scripts}.

\subsection{Usage}

All the utilities are design to be able to read from the standard input and to
write the standard output.
